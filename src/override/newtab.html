        <p>Today, I make a promise to myself. I promise that I will work with a single minded focus on my goals and objectives. I will set my priorities, and I will complete them, without fail and without question.</p>
        <p>I will be honest with myself. I will work harder, and smarter, than I have ever known. I will push, when it is hardest to push. And as a result, I will achieve, create value, and make an impact on this world. There is no doubt in my mind that I am on my way to achieving my unlimited potential.</p>
        <p>Finally, I remember that life is an adventure. I take it seriously, but I do not let it get me down. I trust myself, my abilities, and the decisions that I make. As long as I have been the man that I want to be, nothing else matters. Of this, I have complete confidence.</p>
